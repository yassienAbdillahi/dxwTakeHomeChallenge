A UK Government acronym search application

## Task

Make a start on building a UK Government acronym search, that allows users to search for an acronym, and will return the matching organisation for that acronym, if one exists.

Use the data from the first table [here](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publication/whitehall-monitor-2018/abbreviations) (listing acronyms and organisation names, from AGO to WG) to power the search..

There is no need to use a database to store this information, you can hardcode it into your application (though feel free to use a database if you prefer!). The application should be viewable in a browser, but you can write the logic in whatever language or framework you prefer (server or client-side).


## User Stories
- [ ] When the user first loads the application, they are presented with a free text search
box
- [ ] When they search for an acronym, the application displays the full organisation
name for that acronym if one exists
- [ ] If no such acronym exists, an appropriate message is displayed
- [ ] An autocomplete is available on the search box, so that as a user begins to type
acronyms that match the letters they entered are presented in a dropdown
- [ ] Partial matching is available (e.g. if a user searches for “DC”, results are returned for
both “DCMS” and “DCLG”)


## How to run it?
This is a web app so just open it in your browser using [this](https://yassienAbdillahi.github.io/dxwTakeHomeChallenge/) link.
